  Information
  ===========

This is a MediaWiki extension that implements automatic creation of links for
specific identifiers. The scope of the identifiers may be restricted to one page
or a group of pages, that is, the identifier will be linkified only on the
specified pages. The extension should be used as {{#autolink:identifier}}.

The information about what identifiers to link where must be provided in a JSON
format on the MediaWiki:autolinker-definition page. The format is as follows:

    {
    "groups" : [
        {
            "name" : "string",
            OPTIONAL "base_url" : "string", END
            "urls" : [ "url", "url", ... ],
        },
        ...
    ],
    "links" : [
        {
            "string" : "string",
            OPTIONAL "on_group" : "name", OR "on_page" : "url", END
            "target" : "url",
        },
        ...
    ],

The 'groups' array defines page groups that can later be used in
'links[].on_group'. Each element in this array defines one page group. A page
group is simply a named set of pages. This set is defined in the 'urls' array.
If all pages in the group have a common title prefix, then it can be moved to
'base_url' attribute. The 'name' attribute defines the name of a group. All
groups should have unique names.

The 'links' array defines identifier -> link target mapping. Each element in the
array defines one mapping: 'string' is the identifier, 'target' is the target
link. The set of pages that a mapping takes effect in can be restricted by
'on_group' or 'on_page' attributes. 'on_group', if defined, must contain a name
of a group that has been defined in the 'groups' array.
